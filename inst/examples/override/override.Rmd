```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here is a code snippet to override the package functionality and render all chunks as regular R chunks. This is useful if the package is not available:

```{r}
knitr::knit_engines$set(reproducibleR = knitr::knit_engines$get("R"))
```

## Some Computation

Here is a computation:

```{reproducibleR simple}
my_sum <- 12
```
