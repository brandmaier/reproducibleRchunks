## Test Suite

This test suite is for manual testing of whether code chunk options work properly. We are testing the following chunk options:

- `include` runs the code but doesnâ€™t show the code or results in the document
- `echo` prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the document

### Test 1: Default options

This is supposed to show code, results and report:

```{reproducibleR}
a <- 1
b <- a + 10
```

### Test 2: Echo = FALSE

This is supposed to show results and report but not the code:

```{reproducibleR echo=FALSE}
summe <- a + b
```

### Test 3: echo = false and report = FALSE

This is supposed to only show the result (12)

```{reproducibleR echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, report=FALSE}
summe2 <- a + b
```

### Test 4: Eval = FALSE

This is supposed to only show the code

```{reproducibleR eval=FALSE}
summe3 <- a + b
```
